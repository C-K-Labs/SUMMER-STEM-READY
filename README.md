❌ Status checking (GET /status/{userID})
❌ JSON parsing and URL encoding
❌ Offline mode support for connection failures

🛡️ 5. Advanced Security System (PARTIALLY REMOVED)
❌ Excessive system process blocking (cmd, powershell, regedit, msconfig, service manager, etc.)
Reason: Prevents system instability during presentation

📊 8. Logging System (SIMPLIFIED)
❌ Background logging thread (performance optimization)
❌ 120+ detailed logging points
Reason: Complexity reduction and performance improvement

⚡ 9. Auto-Start Registry Feature (REMOVED)
❌ System startup auto-execution (registry: WCC_DocumentViewer)
Reason: No permanent system changes needed for presentation

🔒 10. Optional Advanced Features (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
❌ System shutdown prevention (power button, etc.)
Reason: Not implemented in current version


🎯 Final Program Flow for Presentation
Program Execution → Screen takeover (multi-monitor support)
